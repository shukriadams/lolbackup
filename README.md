lolbackup
=========

Requirements : 
--------------
.Net framework 4.0. Also, something that builds .Net Windows applications.
Nunit if you want to build and run tests. Otherwise remove the tests project.


Lolbackup is a simple, no-frills backup tool I wrote for myself several years ago, after a particularly nasty drive bricking. I've always had several drives in my PC, and I needed specific stuff from each one backed up to specific places. I couldn't find a utility that did this seamlessly and freely, so I wrote my own, and it has served me well since. Not only did I manage to retrieve files I accidentally deleted, but after another drive failure, I knew I was covered.

**WARNING : ** Lolbackup is available entirely as is. It can and will delete everything on your system if you set it up incorrectly, so use it wisely and at your own risk. For what it's worth, I've used it every day for years and it's never screwed up once.

You configure Lolbackup from an XML file. There is no fancypants settings control. It's hax0r, alright?
